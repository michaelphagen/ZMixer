# ZMixer
A Mixer originally created for use with Zoom, built in MaxMSP, and intended to be used with Loopback or Soundflower.

Though originally created for use with Zoom, this application can be used with any software that takes a microphone input.

**This project is not affiliated with Zoom in any way.**

Currently development is only for MacOS (though feel free to try it on other platforms!)
